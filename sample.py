#what is python?
#Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics


#2
#what is programming language
#A programming language is a vocabulary and set of grammatical rules for instructing a computer or computing device to perform specific tasks.
# The term programming language usually refers to high-level languages, such as python.


#3
#what is software and how many types

# what is python script
#Basically, a script is a text file containing the statements that comprise a Python program.
# Once you have created the script, you can execute it over and over without having to retype it each time


#5
#What kind of applications we can develop using python
#Python is best suited for work related to maths & data.
# Python is a high-level general-purpose programming language that can be applied to many different classes of problems.

#6
#How to develop standalone application in python
#The easiest way to create an application from a Python script is simply by dropping it on the BuildApplication applet
# in the main Python folder. BuildApplication has a similar interface as BuildApplet: you drop a script on it and it will process it,
# along with an optional .rsrc file.


#7
#How to develop distributed application in python
#is a high-performance asynchronous messaging library aimed at use in scalable distributed or concurrent applications.
# It provides a message queue, but unlike message-oriented middleware, a Ã˜MQ system can run without a dedicated message broker.
# The library is designed to have a familiar socket-style API.


#8
#Is python a case senstive language
#Yes, python  is a case senstive language


#9
#Where we can use python
#Python is a general purpose and high level programming language.
# You can use Python for developing desktop GUI applications, websites and web applications.

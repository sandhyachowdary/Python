OOPS :
oops stands for "object oriented programming system"
-> oops is a mechanisam to write  programs using class objects
->As per "OOAD"(object oriented analysis & design) we have 4 principles under OOPS
They are:
    1.Abstraction
    2.Encapsulation
    3.Inheritence
    4.polymorphism
->Any programming language which supports the principles of oops is called oopl(object oriented programming language)
->python is object orient programming language


Abstraction:
            Abstraction is process of gathering required data and hiding un neccessary data

What is data?
    Data is a collection of row facts.which doesnot have any meaning in the real world.


 What is information?
    Meaningful data (or) Processed data is called as information

  ex: student 23 is present with 98.34% ->Meaning


  Encapsulation:
            Encapsulation is a process of binding state and behaviour in to container.
          -> State represents variables
          -> Behaviour represent methods
          -> Container represent class
          Encapsulation is a process of binding related variables and methods in to a class


 Inheritance:
            Inheritance is a process of getting properties (variables and methods) from one class to another class
            The class which is providing properties is called as "Super Class"
            The class which is accepting properties from super class is called as "Sub Class"


 Polymorphism:
             "poly"- means "Many"
             "Morph"-means "Behaviour"
             Polymorphism means many behaviours under "One Name"

 class:
       class is a collection of related variables and methods
       To declare a class we use "class" keyword
       syntax:
                class class_name:
                        variables
                          or
                        methods


 Variables:
           Variable is named memory location.Which stores some data temporarily
           In python we have 5 types of variables:
           1.Global variable
           2.static variable
           3.Argument variable
           4.Instance variable
           5.Local Variable


Static Variables:
            The variable which are declared inside the class and out side method are called as static variables
            To call static variables we use class name
            Static variables we get memory at class loading time
            Static  variables will holds common value for all objects
            Static variable will get memory for one time




#ex:
class employee:
    comp-name : "kvana"
    comp-cno  : 9876543210
    print(employee.comp-name)
    print(employee.comp-cno)
output:
kvana
9876543210

comp-name,comp-cno are static variables and aslo static memory



Instance variables:
        The variable which are declared inside the methods (or) constructor using "self" word are called as instance variable
        To call instance variable we use object (or) object reference variable
        Instance variable will get memory after object creation
        Instance variable will get memory for every object


Note: "Self" represents current class object


what is object ?
Object is an instance of a class

Instance means allocating sufficient memory for instance variable of a class


What is the difference between static and instance variable?

            Static                                      Instance
1.Static Variable are declared inside the           1.Instance Variable are declared inside the methods (or)
class and outside the method                           constructor using "Self" word
2.Static Variable we use to call by                 2.Instance Variable we used to call object or object refer variable
clas name
3.Static Variable will get memory                   3.Instance variable will get memory after object creation
at class loading time
4.Static Variable will holds common value            4.Instance variable will hold unique for each object
for all objects
5.Static Varibale will get memory for
one time




Methods:
        Method is a collection of statements which perform an operation
        To define a method we use "def" keywords
        The methods which is defined once can call for multiple times
        The methods are defined inside the class in python we have "3" types of methods:
        1.Static Method
        2.Instance Method
        3.Class Method
        The above "3" methods are defined in "4" ways.
        1.Method without argument and without return
        2.Method with argument and without return
        3.Method without arguments and with return
        4.Method with argument and with return

Static Method:
        Static Method are ment to perform operations on static variable
        To declare  a static method we use "@" decorator i.e "@staticmethod"
        To call  static method we use class-name


Instance Method:
        Instance Method will perform operations on stance variable
        By default instance method will take 'self' as a default parameter
        'self' represents current class object
        To call instance method we use object/ object refrence variable
ex:
        class student:
                def assign(self,rno,marks):
                       self.rno = rno
                       self.marks = marks
                def display(self):
                      print(self.rno)
                      print(self.marks)
        x = student()
        x.assign(101,350)
        x.display()
           (or)
        y = student
        y.assign(102,360)
        y.dispaly()



Constructor:
            It is aspecial operator kind of method,which is used to intialize the instance variable of a class
            Constructor name must be "__init__()"
            Constructor will take self as a default argument
            Constructor is called at the line of object creation





ex:
        class employee:
              def __init__(self):
                    print("I am a constructor")
              def display(self):
                    print("I am on display")
        e = employee()
        e.display()
        output:
         I am on constructor
         I am display

 Note: If a method is defined with "__du__" Double under scores for both sides are called as "Dunder" method or "magic" method


 ex:
        __init__()
        __del__()
        __iter__()
        __next__()
        etc


Example on Default constructor (A constructor without argument) :
The default constructor will intialize common values for every object
ex:

    class employee:
        def __init__(self):
            self.idno = 101
            self.name = "Sandhya"

        def display(self):
            print("idno :",self.idno)
            print("name :",self.name)

    e1 = employee()
    e1.display


 employee is class
 __init__ is default constructor
 self.idno and self.name are instance variable
 display is instance method
 e1 is global variable

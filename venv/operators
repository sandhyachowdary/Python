Operators:
    Operator will perform operation on operands(2)
    Python is providing 8 types of operations
    1.Arthematic operator
    2.Relation operator
    3.Logical operator
    4.Assignment operator
    5.Short hand assignment operator
    6.Bitwise operator
    7.Membership operator
    8.Identity operator

Arthematic operators:
        + -> 10+3 = 13
        - -> 10-3 = 7
        * -> 10*3 = 30
        / -> 10/3 = 3.333
        % -> 10%3 = 1
       // -> 10//3= 3
       ** -> 10**3 =100



In python the Arthematic operators with follow  "BODMAS" Rule
B -> ()
O -> **

B & O are of same priority

D -> / % //
m -> *

D & M are of same priority

A -> +
S -> -

A & S are of same priority

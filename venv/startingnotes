Key Words:
        Key Word are referred word by python to define syntax of a program
        As per python 3.6.4 version we have 33 keywords
        In 33 keywords "False,None,True" will begin with capital letters and rest of 30 keywords are in small letters



To view list of keywords:
                -->import keyword
                -->print (keyword.kwlist)
           (or)
                                    ..^ keyword
                                    |
                --> import keyword as k----->alias name
                --> print(k.kwlist)


Module:
        Module means a python file


steps to create a module:
    ->Open IDLE from start menu
    ->In IDLE menu select "File" and "New File"
    ->Write the program
    ->Save the file using any name but the exit must be ".py" only
    ->To Run the module use "F5"



Steps to run module using command prompt:
    ->Open command prompt
    ->In command prompt move to module (python "File") Location
    ->Type the command as python File Name.py



Ex: #Write a script to print the name for 10 times
    print("satya \n" * 10)

    print - (Function)
    satya - ("string")
    \n - (New Line)
    * - (operator)
    10 - (value)



Data Types:
     10 - int
     10.25 -Float
     True/False - Boolean
    { ''
     " "} are used for one line sting

     {'''  '''
       """  """} are used for multiline string


     [10,20,30] --->List
     {
       (10,20,30)
          (or)
       10,20,30 } ---> tuple


      {10,20,30} --> set



      {10:A, 20:b} ----> dict (dictionary)






 variable:
    Named Variable location is which stores some data temporarily


 Syntax:
        variable name = value
        -> In python variable are dynamic type.It means the type of variable is decided at RunTime


 ex: id no = 101
    print(id no) #101            id no->101->int class object

 ex: salary = 19500.00
    print(salary) #19500.000        salary -> 19500.00 -> float class object


 Note: To view type of variable we use "type()" built in function
 type():


 ex:
    a = 100
    print(100) #100
    print(type(a)) # <class 'int'>      a -> 100 -> int -> class object


    b = 10.25
    print(b) #10.25
    print(type(b) # <class'float'>      b -> 10.25 -> float -> class object


    c = True
    print(c) #True
    print(type(c)) #<class'bool'>       c -> True -> True -> boolean class object




  #Example Script on one line and multi line string

        name = Ravi
        address = "R.Ravi,
                    s/o R R R,
                    satya Tech,
                    Hyderabad"

       print(name)
       print(address)



 Assignment Operator:
                    The Assignment operator will execute from 'Right' to 'Left'

                   L = R
                   L = will be  variable only
                   R = Value -> a = 100
                   variable -> b = a
                   expression -> c = a+b
                   function-calling -> x = len("satya")
                   object -> y = employee()


* In python we can declare multiple variables in one line


ex: a,b,c = 10,20,30
    print(a,b,c) #10 20 30

    a,b,c,d = 10, satya , 10.25, True
    print(a,b,c,d) #10 satya 10.25 True
    print(a) #10
    print(b) #satya
    print(c) #10.25
    print(d) #True


* In python if multiple variables are holding common value will refer to same object

ex:
 a = 10                 a&c -> 100 -> int class object
 b = 200                  b -> 200 -> int class object
